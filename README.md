### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CucumberSwift, it's been a pet project for a while, I wanted an easier way of doing BDD on iOS!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust in my spare time, but mostly I'm an Apple Developer. 

#### About me:
My primary motivation is helping people. As Software Engineer's we can sometimes get so wrapped up in a problem we forget what the end goal is. I do my best to make sure the software I help write makes a difference, and is based off of user needs.

I spend most of my free time honing my skills in my favorite programming language (Swift). I've become an avid believer in automated testing and DevOps practices. I incorporate that into both my professional code and my personal code.

I have managed to become a Principal Engineer largely by working with people far smarter than I am, and learning from them. I owe much of my success specifically to World Wide Technology where I continue to enjoy opportunities to work with a very diverse group of intelligent people.
