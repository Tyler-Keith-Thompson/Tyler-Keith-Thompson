### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CucumberSwift, it's been a pet project for a while, I wanted an easier way of doing BDD on iOS!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust in my spare time, but mostly I'm an Apple Developer. 

#### About me:
I've been writing code since 2008. I became an Apple developer in 2012 and have always loved it. Swift is absolutely my favorite programming language and I'm always down for sharing what I've learned and learning from others. I joined WWT late 2016, and I currently work in the Virtual Office.
